# SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINE

### IMPLEMENTION OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY FOR RECOGNITION DIGITS

- Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression
- The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using  SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the model is calculated
